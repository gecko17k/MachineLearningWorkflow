Getting started.

The eaiest way to get started is by downloading Anaconda, and creating a Python 3.7 "mlbc" environment.
  
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
(which python version, 3.x [as in 3.something, like 3.7])

1. Go to Anaconda command prompt and create an enviornment:

>> conda create -n mlbc anaconda python=3.7

Here we have created a python 3.7 environment named "mlbc", that contains all packages 
available at Anaconda such as Numpy, Scipy, etc.

You have now created the environment. To view the jupyter notebook do the following:

2. Go to Anaconda Prompt and activate mlbc environment
>> activate mlbc

3. Run jupyter
>> jupyter notebook

4. This launches in your browser, now naviate to the folder and select the .ipynb file.
